## Introduction
Essentially they are using single-cell RNA sequencing on mice to understand gene expression of all cell types in the heart except for cardiomyocytes. In scRNA-seq, you isolate RNA from a single cell, use reverse transcription to convert it into complementary DNA, and then amplify that DNA either through the use of PCR or in vitro transcription. With that amplified DNA, you can then generate a sequencing library and sequence it. This method is advantageous because it can often reveal rare cell types in a population. However, one caveat is that it is impossible to gather 100% information on all RNA in each of the cells due to the very small amount present. Overall, thoguh, these experiments allow us to understand the structure and function of the cardiac cell makeup. 

## Results
**Figure 1:** scRNA-Seq Analysis of Cardiac Non-myocytes Reveals Major Cardiac Cell Types
<ol type="a">
  <li>Shows the methodology of selecting cells for scRNA-seq. They reduce the percentage of endothelial cells to approx. 10% of total non-myocytes because they did not want to oversample endothelial cells (largest cardiac cell population and is mostly made of miscrovascular endothelial cells).
  </li>
  <li>Through dimensionality reducation and unsupervised cell clustering, 12 distinct cell clusters were revealed.
  | Endothelial cells | |
  | Fibroblasts | |
  | Granulocytes | |
  | Lymphocytes | |
  | Pericytes | |
  | Macrophages | |
  | Dendritic cell-like cells | |
  | Schwann cells | |
  | Smooth muscle cells | |</li>
  <li>Previously known markers of cell types and heatmaps of their corresponding cell type according to this group's results.</li>
  <li>Heatmap of 10 significant marker genes for each identified cell population. "Fibroblast are associated with extracellular matrix, leukocytes are associated with immune-regulatory terms, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are associated with vascular development/homeostasis terms, and Schwann cells are associated with neuro-regulatory terms."</li>
</ol>

**Figure 2:** Major Cardiac Cell Types Harbor Subpopulations that Reflect a Hierarchy of Transcriptional Diversity
<ol type="a">
    <li>Subclustering of populations shows differences within major cell types. Here, I believe they are only showing the leukocytes and and the cell sub-types (myeloid and lymphoid).</li>

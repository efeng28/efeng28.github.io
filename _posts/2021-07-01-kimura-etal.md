# Introduction
BAG3 is a co-chaperone protein that is important for protein quality control (PQC), therefore maintaining proteostasis (proteo-stasis = protein equilibrium)[^1]. It does this through chaperone-assisted selective autophagy. However, "an amino acid exchange (P209L) in the HSPB8 binding site of the human co-chaerone BAG3 gives rise to severe childhood cardiomyopathy" (cardio-myo-pathy = heart muscle suffering/disease). P209L is a point mutation, but its precise location has not been discovered. There are three main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive[^2].

| Dilated cardiomyopathy | LV is dilated (volume increases). Most frequent is in middle-aged men. Can be caused by coronary artery disease, heart attack, or poor genetics. |
| Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | LV wall thickens (volume decreases). Condition extremely severe if during childhood. Can be linked to family history and some genetic mutations. |
| Restrictive cardiomyopathy | Heart muscle is stiff and less flexible. Any age but typically affects older people. Idiopathic (can happen for no apparent reason), or other diseases in the body that end up affecting the heart (e.g. amyloidosis). |

In this paper, the authors want to generate better replicates of the BAG3<sup>P209L</sup> mutation (and the subsequent phenotype) by using human transgenic mice. With these mouse models, we can better understand the mechanisms of BAG3<sup>P209L</sup>.

Kimura, K., Ooms, A., Graf-Riesen, K. *et al*. Overexpression of human BAG3<sup>P209L</sup> in mice causes restrictive cardiomyopathy. *Nat Commun* **12**, 3575 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23858-7

BAG3 is a co-chaperone protein that is [important for protein quality control (PQC)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2017.00177/full). "An amino acid exchange (P209L) in the HSPB8 binding site of the human co-chaerone BAG3 gives rise to severe childhood cardiomyopathy" (cardio-myo-pathy = heart muscle suffering/disease). There are three main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive.

| Dilated cardiomyopathy | LV is dilated (volume increases). Most frequent is in middle-aged men. Can be caused by coronary artery disease, heart attack, or poor genetics. |
| Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | LV wall thickens (volume decreases). Condition extremely severe if during childhood. Can be linked to family history and some genetic mutations. |
| Restrictive cardiomyopathy | Heart muscle is stiff and less flexible. Any age but typically affects older people. Idiopathic (can happen for no apparent reason), or other diseases in the body that end up affecting the heart (e.g. amyloidosis). |

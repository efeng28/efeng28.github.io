My journey to building my own website started freshman year with a Google search of "Eric Feng." I quickly learned that there were already two well-established Eric Feng's on the internet: one a prominent software executive (with his own Wikipedia page!) and one a public speaker who had already published three books. I wasn't too worried, though; I was having no trouble being one of the six Eric's at Mounds View.

Two years later, I decided to make my own push towards Eric Feng internet fame. I knew I wanted to build my own website, so I started by thinking of ideas for a domain name. My first thought was ericfeng.com, but unfortunately that was already taken by one of the aforementioned Eric Feng's. Next up on the list was efeng.com, but that was being used by a Chinese plastics company. After consulting with some friends and family, I finally decided on ericjfeng.com (if your name is also Eric J. Feng, I'm sorry).

Next, I needed to actually make the website. I wanted to build it own my own, without the help of any website builders. Not only does making the site myself offer full customization, it also offers good programming experience. After Googling around for a bit, I discovered that Github offers free website hosting. I was all set... except for that I did not know what I wanted to do with my website.

I looked around for some examples, and a couple that really caught my eye were made by two of my mentors ([Jon Wang](https://www.jonxwang.com) and [Will Sun](https://www.iamwillsun.com)). The design of Jon's site appealed to me as clean and modern, and I liked the blog and portfolio content of Will's site. With some coding magic, I was able to create this website. It is visually similar to Jon's site and has content inspired by Will's site.

So, what are the benefits of your own site? First of all, a website is a good way for you to claim a domain name before somebody else does (in my case, I  missed out on ericfeng.com, but I was lucky enough to get ericjfeng.com). It's also useful for making it into [Google's billions of daily searches](https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/), which allows you some control over your public image. Most importantly, you get your own site to show off whatever you want!

The possibilities are endless: professionals can expand upon their short resumes, writers can publish tastes of their work with shorter stories, freelancers can market their skills, and small businesses can expand into the online market. Websites are even perfect for families to store nostalgic photos and share details about upcoming family gatherings!

In the words of entrepreneur [Laurence Bradford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurencebradford/), "The best time to start building a website was yesterday, but the second-best time is today." A personal website is an investment that you won't want to miss out on in the current age of technology.

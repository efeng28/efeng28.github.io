Hey! My name is Eric and I am a junior at Mounds View High School. I live in the Twin Cities suburbs with my parents, a sister, and a dog named Lili.

I spend most of my time working in the lab or working on my coding skills through various projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing violin, typing, playing table tennis, typing, and hanging out with friends.

Hey! My name is Eric and I am a junior at Mounds View High School. I live in the Twin Cities suburbs with my parents, my sister, and my dog named Lili. I also have a second sister who is married, and they are doing their residencies in Cleveland, Ohio. They have a cute son named Matthew!

I spend most of my time working in the lab or working on my coding skills through various projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing violin, typing, playing table tennis, running, and hanging out with friends.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email!

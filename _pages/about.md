Hey! My name is Eric and I am a freshman at Vanderbilt. I graduated from Mounds View High School, which is a suburb in the Twin Cities. I have two older sisters, one who is currently a sophomore at Wellesley College. My other sister is married and doing her residency at the Cleveland Clinic. She has a cute son named Matthew!

Outside of school, I spend a lot of time working in the lab and writing food reviews on Instagram. In my free time, I enjoy playing violin, collecting CDs, reading, and playing table tennis with friends.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email at [eric.j.feng@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:eric.j.feng@vanderbilt.edu)!

Hey! My name is Eric and I am a senior at Mounds View High School. I live in the Twin Cities suburbs with my parents and my dog named Lili. I also have two older sisters, one who is currently a freshman at Wellesley College. My other sister is married, and they are doing their residencies at the Cleveland Clinic. They have a cute son named Matthew!

Outside of school, I spend most of my time working in the lab or working on my coding skills through various projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing violin, collecting CDs, and playing table tennis with friends.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email at [feng0198@umn.edu](mailto:feng0198@umn.edu)!

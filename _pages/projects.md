### [Laboratory Research](https://www.heart.umn.edu/our-research/van-berlo-lab) (6/2019-Present)
I have been working in Dr. Jop van Berlo's lab at the University of Minnesota since June 2019, and it has been an amazing experience so far. I am currently working to create a time course of murine cardiomyocyte maturation in order to better understand why induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes persist in a fetal-like state.

### Science Olympiad Test-Writing
I have written high school Science Olympiad tests for Brown, Harvard, and Yale. I have also test-reviewed for Duke, the University of Pennsylvania, and UT-Austin. I would love to write more tests and direct a tournament in college!

### [National Honor Society](https://moundsviewnhs.com/) (10/2019-Present)
This was my first exposure to computer programming. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website. I also learned how to use SQL databses for the purpose of tracking NHS volunteering hours. I helped redesign the website in 2020.

### Personal Website (11/2019-Present)
I created this website for the purpose of sharing my thoughts and claiming this domain name. I registered my domain through Google Domain, and I am hosting the website through GitHub pages.

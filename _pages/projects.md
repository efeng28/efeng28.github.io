### Personal Website
I registered my domain through Google Domains because of the relatively simple interface. I am hosting the website through GitHub pages because it is free and offers complete control over what you want to do with the website. It is also great for Jekyll websites.

### Pill Push
We are currently looking somebody who has experience with basic graphic design for apps and websites. Please email me at [feng0198@umn.edu](mailto:feng0198@umn.edu) for more information.

### [National Honor Society](https://moundsviewnhs.com/)
This was my first exposure to computer programming. The domain is registered through GoDaddy, and the website is hosted through Google Cloud Platform because we are using a SQL server. I am maintaining and constantly improving the website.

### [Laboratory Research](https://www.heart.umn.edu/our-research/van-berlo-lab)
I have been working in Dr. Jop van Berlo's lab at the University of Minnesota since June 2019, and it has been an amazing experience so far. I am currently working to create a time course of murine cardiomyocyte maturation in order to better understand why induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes persist in a fetal-like state.
